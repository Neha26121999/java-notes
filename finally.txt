2) if exception not occurs then after try directly finally block executes.

3) finally is those type of which is always executes after try whether the exception occurs or not.

uses of finally block
1) try
{
   //risky code
}
catch

jo resources hum try ke andar kholte hain unko hum finally ke andar close karte hai.
if any exception occurs while reading or writing a file,hen below code will not execute and thus resource will not close.
