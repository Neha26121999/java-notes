Non Acsess Modifiers

Static keyword is a non access modifier.
1.class level variable can be a static  variable but local variables cannot be a static.
2) class variable directly access from the class there is no need of creating the object.
3) Static variables are used for memory management

The Static variable can be used to refer to the common property or value for all objects,
for example: company name of employess,college name of students etc

we can call static method directly without creating object.

class Testt
{
  static void display()
  {
     System.out.println("1");
  }
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
     Testt.display();
  }
}

Rules for static method

1. static methods belong to the class not to the object
2. a static method can be accessed directly by classname.there is no need for creating any object.
3. A static method can access only static data it cannot access not static data.
4. A static mathod can callonly other static methods and cannot call a non-static method.
5.A static method cannot refer to this or super keyword anyway.
