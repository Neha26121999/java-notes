There are 6 pillors of oops...
1.class
2.objects and methods
3.inheritance
4. polymorphism
5.Abstraction
6.Encapsulation

what is oops??
1)  class is a collection of objects
2)  class is not a real world entity it is just a template or blueprint or prototype.
Example:  Animal,birds etc
                 Animal is a class and dog is a  object.
3)  class does not occupy memory.

Syntax:
   accessModifier Class ClassName{
            method
            constructor
             fields
             blocks
             nested class
}
