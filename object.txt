                           Object

1. Object is an instance of class.
2. Object is real world entity.
3. Object occupies memory.

Objects consist of:
1.  Identity - name (every object have unique name)
2.  State/Attribute - color,breed,age
3.  Behaviour - Eat,run,bark

How to create an object:
1. new keyword
2. newInstance()method 
3. clone method
4. Deserialization factory method

steps of creating the object with the new keyword:
1) Declaration : It is declaring a variable name with an object type
example: Animal buzo;(where Animal is classname and buzo is reference variable name or object name)

2. Instantiation : 
1. This is when memory is allocated for an object.
2. The new keyword is used to create the object.
3. A reference to the object that was created is returned from the new keyword.
example : buzo= new

3.Initialization: 
      After Instantiation Initialization complete the formation of object
  buzo= new Animal();(we will create the constructor of class)
