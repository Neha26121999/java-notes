                          Encapsulation
In java there is a mechanism of wrapping the data(variables and code acting on the data(methods) together as a single unit.

steps to achieve the encapsulation
1. Declare the variables of a class as private.
2. provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values..

In encapsulation the variables of a class willbe hidden from other classes,and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.This concept is known as Data Hiding.
