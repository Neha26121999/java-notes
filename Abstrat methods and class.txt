                        Abstract Method

1)A method without body (no implementation) is known as 
abstract method.
2) if any class have abstract method than it is compulsory to make this class abstract.but vice versa is not true.
3) if a regular class extends an abstract class, then the class must have implement all the abstract methods of abstract parent class or it has to be declared abstract as well.
4) Abstract methods in an abstract class are meant to overridden in derived concreate classes otherwise compile time error will be thrown.
5) Abstract classes cannot be instantiated,means we cant create n object of abstract class..
