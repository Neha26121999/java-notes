                      Inheritance
It is inheriting the properties of parent class into child class
OR 
Inheritance isthe procedure by which one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent class. 

Advantages:
1.code reusability
2.we can achieve polymorphish through inheritance

Disadvantage:
classes are tightly coupled.so when we change in one class it will change all classes.

              Types of Inheritance
1.Single
2.Multilevel
3.hiersarical
4.Multiple(because java only support one super class)
5.Hybrid(hybrid inheritance is a combination of above 4 inheritance but java does not support multiple inheritance so it is not support hybrid)

Java only supports 3 types of inheritance
single,multilevel,hierarical

but saari properties ek class kii dusri class se inherit nii hoti..
for example 
1. agar hum ek class ka constructor bnaate hai to wo kabhi dusri class se inherit nii hota..
2. agar method private ho to wo bhi kabhi inherit nii hota
