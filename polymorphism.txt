                          Polymorphism
polymorphism word is created by two words
                poly+morphism

           poly means many
           morphism means forms
There are two types of polymorphism-
1.Compile time polymorphism
1)  static polymorphism(can be achieve through method overloading)

2.Run time polymorphism
1) Dynamic polymorphism(can be acieve through method overriding)

Method Overloading:

1)  methods are of same name.
2) methods are of same class.
3) methods are of different arguments..
      no. of argument will be differ
      sequence of argument will be differ
      type of argument will be differ

Method Overriding:

1)  Methods are of Same name
2) Different class
3)  same arguments
